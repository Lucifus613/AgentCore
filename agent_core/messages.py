"""OpenAI-compatible message types — provider-agnostic chat representation.

Messages are plain ``dict`` matching the OpenAI Chat Completions wire format,
so they round-trip through any compatible endpoint with no translation:

    {"role": "system" | "user" | "assistant" | "tool",
     "content": str | None,
     "name"?: str,
     "tool_calls"?: [ToolCall],
     "tool_call_id"?: str,
     "reasoning_content"?: str}

A ``Message`` may additionally carry in-process bookkeeping keys that are NOT
part of that format (``duration_ms`` / ``is_error`` / ``spill_refs`` / ``origin``). The wire
format is the subset named by :data:`WIRE_MESSAGE_KEYS`, and :func:`for_wire`
is what enforces the boundary — see the note on each key for why the split is
not simply "everything OpenAI documents".

Anthropic content-block shape (``[{"type": "thinking", ...}, {"type": "text", ...}]``)
is preserved as the ``content`` value when the underlying client returns it;
callers that need flat text use :func:`text_of`.

This module replaces the former framework-specific message classes with a
small, dependency-free wire contract.

# ``cache_control`` is absent on purpose: Anthropic prompt caching attaches it

    Today this is a backstop rather than a fix: the keys it can remove
    (``duration_ms``, ``is_error``) are only ever set on ``display_history``,
    which is persisted and restored separately from the model-facing ``history``
    and is never what reaches a client. But that invariant currently lives in a
    comment, and ``OpenAIClient`` passes each message dict to the SDK verbatim —
    so a single stray key anywhere in the loop, a compactor or a workflow lands
    on the wire and, on a served checkpoint, off its training distribution. This
    makes the invariant enforced at the one place it matters.

    Key ORDER is preserved by iterating each message rather than rebuilding in a
    fixed order: some served checkpoints are byte-shape sensitive (see the note
    above the builders). A list with nothing to strip is returned unchanged, so
    the common path is not merely equal but identical.

    Only the OpenAI-compatible client needs this. The Anthropic and Responses
    clients project messages through ``_to_anthropic_msg`` /
    ``_to_responses_input``, which read named keys and therefore cannot carry an
    unexpected one onto the wire.
