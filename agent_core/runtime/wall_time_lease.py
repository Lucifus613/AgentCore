"""Renewable wall-time lease shared by live intervention and loop guards.

The production ``serve`` process receives follow-up user messages while a
workflow is already running.  A successfully queued ``add`` starts a fresh
interactive turn, so timeout enforcement must use a sliding lease rather than
the task's original start time.

The object is deliberately synchronous and thread-safe:

* the stdin reader dispatches onto the event loop today, but embedded callers
  may renew from another thread;
* deadline readers sit on hot paths (LLM/tool timeout clamping) and must not
  await;
* the same object is carried through ``scope_metadata`` without introducing a
  dependency from the intervention add-on back into the scheduler.

When explicitly configured, live ``serve`` enforces
``MIROHARNESS_TASK_WALL_TIME_S`` with this lease inside the agent process, so
renewal does not depend on Worker Shell understanding a new acknowledgement
field. Renewal details remain on the ``queued`` acknowledgement for
observability. A separate absolute session ceiling prevents unlimited renewal.
