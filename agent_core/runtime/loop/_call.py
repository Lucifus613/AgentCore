# attempt got the full configured timeout regardless of remaining wall
# — an attempt with a fresh 1200 s budget could launch with 90 s of wall
# left. Each attempt now clamps its timeout to the
# remaining budget, refuses to start under the floor, and abandons
# backoff sleeps that would cross the deadline.
#
# Floor: below this many remaining seconds an LLM attempt can't return
# anything useful — fail fast with reason="wall_deadline" so the loop
# stops cleanly and the post-loop salvage (force_final_answer) gets the
# reserve instead. The remaining budget is not read from here: the product
# owns that lookup and injects it as the ``wall_deadline_remaining``
# callback, so this package never touches context-local storage.
# The value is the public ``loop_types.WALL_LLM_REFUSE_S`` so a host observer
# can refuse a new call at exactly the threshold this loop refuses at; the
# private name stays because tests rebind it on this module.

    exponential 2/4/8/16/32s capped at 60 for timeouts and generic errors;
    429 honours ``Retry-After`` (clamped at 300s) when present, else
    exponential 30/60/120/240s capped at 300.

    Failure modes:

    - **Non-transient HTTP (400 schema, 401/403 auth, 404 route)**:
      raises :class:`LLMCallExhausted` immediately (reason=``non_transient``)
      — retrying won't help and burning fallback keys/chain legs is just
      slower failure.
    - **Chain-aware fallback signal** (``model_not_found`` / overload /
      credit-exhausted / safety-filter — anything ``is_retriable_with_fallback``
      flags): raises immediately (reason=``chain_advance``). Same-key retry
      can't change the outcome; the next chain leg may.
    - **Retries exhausted on transient errors** (timeout / stream stall
      / 5xx / 429 / proxy-wrap): raises (reason=``exhausted``) carrying
      the last transient exception.

    Streaming calls additionally run under the inter-chunk stall
    watchdog (:class:`LLMStreamStalled`,
    ``LLM_STREAM_STALL_S`` under any supported prefix, default 180 s): a stream that
    goes silent mid-flight is aborted and retried like a timeout
    instead of pinning the attempt for the full ``timeout``. After
    ``LLM_STREAM_STALL_MAX`` under any supported prefix (default
    2) — and only when an outer provider chain is active — the call
    raises ``LLMCallExhausted(reason="chain_advance")`` instead of
    retrying the same black-holed endpoint. What the caller does with it
    is turn-dependent and decided by the caller's loop: a turn-1
    exhaustion is re-raised to the outer chain wrapper to rotate to the next
    leg; past turn 1 the loop stops with ``llm_error`` and hands off to
    salvage. Either way the retry budget is no longer burned on a dead
    gateway.

    When ``retry_wait_fixed`` is set (int seconds), all transient retries
    use that fixed wait regardless of error class — used by noisy-endpoint
    workflows — a self-hosted endpoint at high concurrency, where stream
    timeouts stampede and the server-side worker recovery cycle is longer
    than the exponential schedule's early attempts. A fixed
    60-90s wait gives the worker pool one full recovery cycle between
    attempts.

    ``runaway_state`` (optional, mutable dict the caller keeps alive
    across turns) enables the reasoning-runaway recovery documented at
    :data:`RUNAWAY_STATE_KEY`: a successful-but-empty capped completion
    is resampled same-key at a reduced ``max_tokens`` with transient guidance
    instead of being returned for the loop to nudge blind. The runaway
    retries share the ``max_retries`` attempt budget; an unrecovered
    runaway is returned as-is (never raised) so existing nudge handling
    remains the floor.

    Streaming reasoning can be stopped before it reaches the provider cap by
    setting ``reasoning_only_timeout_s`` and/or
    ``reasoning_only_max_tokens``. The semantic guard remains armed only while
    the stream has reasoning but no non-whitespace visible text or tool-call
    delta. It shares the same reduced-cap recovery path as a completed
    capped-empty response.

    ``logical_call_timeout_s`` is a separate opt-in deadline spanning gate
    wait, all physical attempts, and retry backoff. It never extends an earlier
    run-level wall deadline. Products with execution-scope storage inject that
    deadline through ``wall_deadline_remaining``; AgentCore never imports a
    product's context-local storage.

    Callers wrap with try/except :class:`LLMCallExhausted` and decide
    whether to surface (chain advance) or degrade (partial content).
